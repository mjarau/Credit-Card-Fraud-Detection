# Credit Card Fraud Detection
In this project, several Machine Learning classification models were used and evaluated in order to determine the best suited ML model for credit card fraud detection.

## Data
The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection. It consists of transactions made by credit cards in September by European cardholders. 
The data can be obtained from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
